Functional connectivity is a common approach in analysing resting state fMRI data.
The Python tool Nilearn provides utilities to extract and denoise time-series on a parcellation.
Nilearn also has methods to compute functional connectivity.
While Nilearn provides useful methods to generate connectomes,
there is no standalone one stop solution to generate connectomes from fMRIPrep outputs.
`giga-connectome` (a BIDS-app!) combines Nilearn and TemplateFlow to denoise the data, generate timeseries,
and most critically `giga-connectome` generates functional connectomes directly from fMRIPrep outputs.
The workflow comes with several built-in denoising strategies and
there are several choices of atlases (MIST, Schaefer 7 networks, DiFuMo, Harvard-Oxford).
Users can customise their own strategies and atlases using the configuration json files.

`giga-connectome` is tested on fMRIPrep LTS (long-term support) 20.2.x.
Currently, `giga-connectome` fully supports outputs of fMRIPrep LTS.
For fMRIPrep 23.1.0 and later, `giga-connectome` does not support ICA-AROMA denoising,
as the strategy is removed from the fMRIPrep workflow.
